# 100 days of Spanish

1. **November 6th, 2023**
  - Worked on a three day trial of rosetta stone latin american spanish, seems like it's probably too basic but I will continue the three days before deciding. I do like the idea of picture based vocab learning since right now I usually think of english words in my head first which makes conversation slow and unnatural.
  - Did a homework excercise on Pretérito perfecto for tutoring lesson tomorrow.
